description: "Bianca received her Bachelor's in Neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh. Bianca is an MD/PhD student with a focus on innovating practices in psychiatric care. She uses tools from neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience to study the function of brain networks that are relevant in psychiatric conditions. Her dissertation work is focused on the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a highly interconnected thalamic region that is involved in both appetitive and aversive stimulus processing, and not well characterized in humans. Bianca is working on mapping the PVT network, examining the effect of early life adversity on the development of this network, and interrogating the function of the PVT in motivational conflict decision-making. She hopes to integrate and support more community voices into psychiatric research. Outside of lab, she loves to go rollerblading along the ocean, dining in Long Beach, and savoring time with loved ones."
