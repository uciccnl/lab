description: "I'm a dual major in Psychology BS and Philosophy with a strong involvement in language science. My research interests include decision making across the lifespan and the impact of language on judgment. Iâ€™m especially drawn to the ways cognitive science and philosophy intersect to explain how we think, feel, and choose. Outside the classroom, I enjoy reading and spending time with my many dogs."
