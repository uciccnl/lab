description: "My name is Aidan Goeschel, and Iâ€™m a 3rd Computer Science major at UCI. My primary research interest lies in developing computational models that represent cognitive processes. These models not only offer potential explanations for certain elements of cognition but also have valuable applications in modern artificial intelligence. Outside of the lab, I enjoy running, reading, and playing guitar."
