description: "
Alexa obtained her B.S. in cognitive neuroscience at UC Davis. After graduating she worked with Timothy Hanks at UC Davis 
studying perceptual decision-making. Following this she worked with Manish Saggar at Stanford researching brain dynamics through 
topological data analysis. Alexa is interested in the neural mechanisms of memory-guided decision-making, particularly with 
respect to navigating graph-structured spaces. Outside the lab she enjoys reading, art, and being outdoors.
