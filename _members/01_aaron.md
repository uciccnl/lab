description: "Aaron Bornstein is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Cognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, where he is affiliated with the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory and the 
Center for Theoretical Behavioral Sciences. His lab's work investigates how behavior optimally adapts to experience and context at multiple timescales and across the lifespan. His professional aspiration is to contribute to the 
critical examination of concepts of psychological and biological normativity. Outside of the lab, he has taught high school in Jerusalem and college in US federal prison; both included some of the best students he will ever know. He 
is originally from New York, and has lived in Boston and San Francisco before settling in his current home of Los Angeles, where he enjoys being an incongruous pedestrian and living at the service of his two cats."
