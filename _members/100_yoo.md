description: "Jungsun graduated from Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) with a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Philosophy. She obtained her M.Sc. degree in Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience from the Free University of Berlin, where she investigated the behavioral and neural interaction of domain-specific memory and value. She also worked as an AI researcher where she led research on explainable AI. In the CCN Lab, Jungsun worked on understanding how people learn and use various kinds of representations to plan, as well as how variable experience shapes our internal representation of the world. In Fall 2025, she joined [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/) as a Postdoctoral Research Associate to work with [Prof. Yael Niv](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/) and [Prof. Nathaniel Daw](https://dawlab.princeton.edu/).

Outside of lab, Jungsun plays violin and viola. She performs in orchestra concerts from time to time and leads an amateur chamber orchestra. She also enjoys working out, boxing, and running."
