description: "Mohit received his B.S. in Neuroscience from the University of Texas, Austin where he researched learning and decision-making with Dr. Alison Preston, Dr. Sharon Noh, and Dr. Christine Coughlin. He previously worked on a number of projects investigating decision-making and learning in older and younger adults using neuroimaging (fMRI) and computational modeling techniques.


After graduating, he chose to further explore his passions and interests in research. Heâ€™s interested in learning more about how decision making is effected by age, and the conditions of learning and decision-making across ones lifespan that could be improved.


Outside the lab, Mohit enjoys reading running, chess, and yelping!"
