description: "Yifan Received his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology with minors in Math and Philosophy at NYU where he developed an interest in Neuroeconomics and Consciousness. He then went pursuing a master degree in Data Science at USC where he worked with researchers in the rodent reversal relearning and human motor learning, helping design experiments and conduct data analysis using various computational models.
 He is now working with Aaron, but has yet to figure out the cool thing(s) to do for the next five years. Outside the lab, Yifan enjoyed mediation, mountaineering, guitar, and cooking. He also has two cats, Only and Roundy whom he loves as dearly as family."
