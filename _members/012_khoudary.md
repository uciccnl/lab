description: "Ari earned a B.S. in Psychology with a second major in Philosophy from Boston College where they worked with [Maureen Ritchey](http://www.thememolab.org/) on reality monitoring in episodic memory. Ari then worked at Duke University, where they researched autobiographical memory and counterfactual thinking with [Felipe De Brigard](https://imclab.org). While at Duke, Ari also served as Program Coordinator for the [Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and Philosophy](https://ssnap.net). 

Ari is co-advised by Aaron Bornstein and [Megan Peters](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/cnclab/). Ari uses computational modeling, human behavior, and neuroimaging to study how humans adaptively use past experiences to reduce uncertainty about the present.

Outside of lab, Ari enjoys tending to their plants, spending time with loved ones, and daydreaming about (nearby) possible worlds."
