description: "Jianle(Shuheng) obtained a B.S. in Psychology from the University of California, Irvine, graduating as an Honors Program Scholar. During his undergraduate studies, he investigated how memory capacity and learning conditions shape inference and generalization, using computational models such as autoencoders to compare human and neural network representations. He is broadly interested in how people learn structured knowledge and use it to guide decisions. Outside of research, he enjoys bouldering, snowboarding, and exploring good food."
