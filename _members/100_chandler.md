description: "Lauryn Chandler is a junior honors psychology major at Howard University. As a Summer Institute in Neuroscience fellow, she worked with Ari Khoudary on how learning dynamics shape memory-guided perceptual decision-making. 
Lauryn is interested in examining how psychological factors affect Black youth. Specifically, she wants to investigate how current measures of 'intelligence' impact Black youth and how their environment impacts their placement in current measures.
Outside the lab, she enjoys thrifting/flea markets, reading, and all things music."
