description: "Yifei received her B.A. in Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley, where she designed psychophysical experiments to investigate how people adapt and learn with various forms of 
feedback.
Following graduation, she decided to further explore her interest in human decision-making processes, specifically how and why people make certain decisions in different contexts, 
before pursuing grad school.
Outside the lab, Yifei enjoys visiting museums, painting, and editing her catâ€™s pictures.
After leaving the lab, Yifei started her PhD in Psychology at Princeton University"
