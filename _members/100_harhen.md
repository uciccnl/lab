description: "Nora received her PhD in May 2024! She is now a postdoctoral researcher working with [Prof. Catherine Hartley](https://www.hartleylab.org/) at New York University."

# "Nora received her B.A. in Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley where she researched learning and decision-making with Anne Collins. After graduating, she worked with Marina Bedny at Johns Hopkins examining neuroplasticity in blind individuals. 
# She’s interested in how memory-guided decision-making changes across development and how early life experiences influence individuals’ susceptibility for substance use disorders, anxiety, and depression later in life. 
# Outside of the lab, Nora enjoys knitting, cooking, and bad reality tv."
