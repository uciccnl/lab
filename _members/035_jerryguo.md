description: "My name is Jerry Guo and I am a 4th year Psychology(B.S.) major at UCI! The research I am interested in include using neural network to represent human participant's data and the finding correlation between neural network and human in the encoding of the memory. Besides research, I like to boulder, snow board and enjoy good food."
