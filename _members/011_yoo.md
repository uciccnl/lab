description: "Jungsun graduated from Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology and Philosophy. She obtained her M.Sc. degree in Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience from the Free University of Berlin, where she investigated the behavioral and neural interaction of domain-specific memory and value at the Heekeren Lab. She also worked as an AI researcher in the Computational Health Informatics Laboratory at the Asan Medical Center where she led research on explainable AI. 

In the CCN Lab, Jungsun is currently working on memory-guided reinforcement learning in humans, and in particular, how people and agents learn and employ various kinds of representations to plan.

Outside of the lab, Jungsun plays violin & viola, and leads an amateur chamber orchestra."
