description: "Jungsun graduated from Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology and Philosophy. She obtained her M.Sc. degree in Social, Cognitive, and Affective Neuroscience from the Free University of Berlin, where she investigated the behavioral and neural interaction of domain-specific memory and value. She also worked as an AI researcher where she led research on explainable AI. In the CCN Lab, Jungsun is currently working on understanding how people learn and use various kinds of representations to plan, as well as how variable experience shapes our internal representation of the world. After graduation, she will join [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/) to work with [Dr. Yael Niv](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/) and Dr. [Nathaniel Daw](https://dawlab.princeton.edu/).

Outside of the lab, Jungsun plays violin & viola, and leads an amateur chamber orchestra (check out my personal website!)."
