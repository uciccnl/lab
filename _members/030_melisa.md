description: "
My name is Melisa Azimihashemi, I am in my 4th year as a cognitive science major. My research interests are primarly focused on 
the brain and how the it works. I am intrigued by the different factors that can influence our memory and decision making 
process. I am also interested in the development of the brain and how it ages over time.
