His research focuses on humanness perception and social decision making across the lifespan. 


At the University of Central Florida, he works with Dr. Nichole Lighthall (UCF), Dr. Robert Wilson (Georgia Institute of Technology), and Dr. Natalie Ebner (University of Florida) on projects that examine the psychological and neural mechanisms of trust-related learning and decision making in aging.
