description: "My name is Roger Chen, and I'm a second year Computer Science & Engineering major at UCI. I'm interested in  computational techniques to model behavior, which I believe have significant potential in numerous fields including cognitive science but also machine learning, robotics, neuroscience, and even healthcare. Outside of my work, I enjoy playing tennis, reading, and catching up with friends."
